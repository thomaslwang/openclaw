/**
 * Guardrails configuration for the OpenClaw integration.
 *
 * The assistant configures its OWN guardrails — text + regex rules (no model
 * needed), and optionally its own model as an LLM judge. Resolution order
 * (lowest → highest precedence):
 *
 *   1. a sensible default policy (below)
 *   2. `<workspace>/openguardrails.json` (agent-editable — this is how an
 *      assistant gives itself guardrails); path overridable via plugin config
 *      `policyPath` or the `OPENGUARDRAILS_POLICY` env var
 *   3. inline plugin config `policy` (set in OpenClaw config under
 *      `plugins.entries.openguardrails.config`)
 *
 * The policy IS an OGR policy.json (composition + config_rules), so the same
 * file format works across every OGR integration (opencode, hermes, python).
